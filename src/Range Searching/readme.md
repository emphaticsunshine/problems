# Range Searching in a Sorted List

## Problem Statement
Given a sorted list with duplicates, and a target number n, find the range in which the number exists (represented as a tuple (low, high), both inclusive. If the number does not exist in the list, return (-1, -1)).

## Example

```
Input: [1, 1, 3, 5, 7], 1
Output: [0, 1]
```

```
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4], 5
Output: [-1, -1]
```
